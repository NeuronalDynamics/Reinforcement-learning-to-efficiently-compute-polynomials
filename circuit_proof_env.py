    """
    A Gymnasium environment for a simplified version of proof generation.
    The goal is to transform an arithmetic circuit that computes a polynomial
    f(x_1, â€¦, x_n) into a more efficient one using a series of rewriting moves.
    
    The circuit is abstractly represented by a state vector:
      [num_add, num_mul, num_scalar, depth]
      
    where:
      - num_add: number of addition gates,
      - num_mul: number of multiplication gates,
      - num_scalar: number of scalar multiplications,
      - depth: an estimated depth of the circuit.
      
    The cost of the circuit is computed as:
      cost = w1 * num_add + w2 * num_mul + w3 * num_scalar + w4 * depth,
    where the weights (w1, w2, w3, w4) are hyperparameters.
    
    Actions:
      0: Combine adjacent addition gates (reduce num_add and possibly depth).
      1: Combine adjacent multiplication gates (reduce num_mul and possibly depth).
      2: Factor out a common scalar (reduce num_scalar and possibly reduce depth).
      3: No operation.
      
    The episode ends when the circuit is sufficiently efficient (cost <= threshold)
    or after a maximum number of steps.
