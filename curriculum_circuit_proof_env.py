class CurriculumCircuitProofEnv(gym.Env):
    """
    A Gymnasium environment for a simplified version of proof generation via arithmetic circuit
    simplification. The goal is to transform an arithmetic circuit computing a polynomial 
    f(x_1, â€¦, x_n) into a more efficient one by applying rewriting moves.
    
    The circuit is represented by a state vector with enhanced features:
      [num_add, num_mul, num_scalar, depth, total_cost, total_gates]
    
    where:
      - num_add: number of addition gates,
      - num_mul: number of multiplication gates,
      - num_scalar: number of scalar multiplications,
      - depth: an estimated depth of the circuit,
      - total_cost: a weighted sum cost,
      - total_gates: total number of operations.
      
    The cost is computed as:
      cost = w1 * num_add + w2 * num_mul + w3 * num_scalar + w4 * depth,
    with fixed weights.
    
    Actions (4 discrete moves):
      0: Combine adjacent addition gates (reduce num_add and depth),
      1: Combine adjacent multiplication gates (reduce num_mul and depth),
      2: Factor out a common scalar (reduce num_scalar, small reduction in depth),
      3: No operation.
      
    The episode terminates when the cost is below a threshold or when a maximum number
    of steps is reached.
    
    Additionally, this environment supports curriculum learning. In curriculum mode,
    the initial circuit starts simple (easy) and gradually increases in complexity
    over episodes.
